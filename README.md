# NLP-notes
This repo contains everything I found excellent and interesting about NLP research. Some are tutorials including slides, videos and blogs, others are some papers I think inspiring.

P.S. This is not an exhausting list about NLP resources like [awesome-nlp](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp), so I try not to put anything I haven't read or articles with a lot depulicated content here. 

BTW, hope we can all survive from the information flood :)



## 1. Introduction
### Big picture
- [Natural Language Processing: State of The Art, Current Trends and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05148)
- [Chinese Information Processing Report (2016)](http://cips-upload.bj.bcebos.com/cips2016.pdf): a very good review discussing both Chinese and English language processing

### Deep Learning for NLP
- [Deep Learning, NLP, and Representations](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/) by Colah: “The **representation perspective** of deep learning is a powerful view that seems to answer why deep neural networks are so effective”
- [Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing by Xipeng Qiu](http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/xpqiu/slides/20160618_DL4NLP@CityU.pdf)
- [Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks for NLP](http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp/): a well-explained blog about CNN and how it's applied to NLP tasks



## 2. Vector Semantics

- [An Intuitive Understanding of Word Embeddings: From Count Vectors to Word2Vec](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/word-embeddings-count-word2veec/) by NSS
### word2vec
- Two awesome tutorials by Chris McCormick: [Part 1 is about Skip-gram](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) and [Part 2 is about negative sampling](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/)



## 3. Text Mining
- An excellent [tutorial](http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_blei_tm/) given by David Blei about LDA





## 4. Summarization

- [How to Run Text Summarization with TensorFlow](http://pavel.surmenok.com/2016/10/15/how-to-run-text-summarization-with-tensorflow/) by Pavel Surmenok
- [文本自动摘要技术 by 万小军](https://github.com/IsakZhang/NLP-notes/blob/master/Data/%E4%B8%87%E5%B0%8F%E5%86%9B-%E6%96%87%E6%9C%AC%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A8%E6%91%98%E8%A6%81%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF.pdf)



## Linguistics

- [Miracles of Human Language: An Introduction to Linguistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-language): a good MOOC about linguistics on Coursera
