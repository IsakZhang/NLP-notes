# NLP-notes
This repository contains some of my NLP notes and everything I found excellent about NLP including videos, tutorials and some papers etc.

## Introduction
### Big picture
- [Natural Language Processing: State of The Art, Current Trends and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05148)
- [Chinese Information Processing Report](http://cips-upload.bj.bcebos.com/cips2016.pdf): a very good review discussing both Chinese and English language processing

### Deep Learning for NLP
- [Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks for NLP](http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp/): a well-explained blog about CNN and how it's applied to NLP tasks
- [Deep Learning, NLP, and Representations by Colah](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/): mainly about word embedding
- [A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing by Yoav Goldberg](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf): very famous but also quite long, haven't read yet
 
 
## Word Representation
### word2vec
- Two awesome tutorials by Chris McCormick: [Part 1](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) is about Skip-gram and [Part 2](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/) is about some methods(including Negative Sampling) to address issues in the basic SG model.
- On word embeddings by Sebastian Ruder: [Part 1](http://ruder.io/word-embeddings-1/index.html) [Part 2](http://ruder.io/word-embeddings-softmax/index.html) [Part 3](http://ruder.io/secret-word2vec/index.html)
- Kaggle Word2Vec Tutorial: 4 parts included [[link]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial)
 
 
## Text Classification
### Text classification using ML algorithms
- [An introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/): provide an overview of SVM and how to apply it in text classification task
 
 
## Sentiment Analysis
- [Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Techniques](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/sentiment.pdf)
 
 
## Summarization
- [文本自动摘要技术 by 万小军](https://github.com/IsakZhang/NLP-notes/blob/master/Data/%E4%B8%87%E5%B0%8F%E5%86%9B-%E6%96%87%E6%9C%AC%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A8%E6%91%98%E8%A6%81%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF.pdf)
